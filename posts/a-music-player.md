# Story
Whenever I am in the car listening to music, all of my music apps keep doing this annoying predictive shuffle? Where it will play the first few songs of the album I picked, but then after like 3-4 songs it will start playing music I never requested. This has led me to cancel all of my music streaming services out of frustration and decide to make my own.

# Plan
- [x] Find an open source music player built with flutter
- [ ] Remove excessive features
- [ ] Reskin to gruvbox theme
- [ ] Implement an RSS feed to follow different band pages and blogs

# Progress 
- I decided on using [this](https://github.com/gokadzev/Musify) project called Musify by Gokadzev. I got it running on my local machine pretty easily and it has all of the features I was looking for.
