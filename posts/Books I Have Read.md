## 2023
I have never really tracked this before. I want to organize this by months eventually but I don't remember when I actually read these books, only that I did this year. 
It would be nice too to link to where you can get these books. 
NOTE: I am omitting my personal reviews from this because my thoughts are scribbled in the books and I would prefer to keep them personal.
