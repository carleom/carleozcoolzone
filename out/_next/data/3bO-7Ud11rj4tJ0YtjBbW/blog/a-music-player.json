Where it will play the first few songs of the album I picked, but then after like 3-4 songs it will start playing music I never requested. This has led me to cancel all of my music streaming services out of frustration and decide to make my own.</p>\n<h1>Plan</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><input checked=\"\" disabled=\"\" type=\"checkbox\"> Find an open source music player built with flutter</li>\n<li><input disabled=\"\" type=\"checkbox\"> Remove excessive features</li>\n<li><input disabled=\"\" type=\"checkbox\"> Reskin to gruvbox theme</li>\n<li><input disabled=\"\" type=\"checkbox\"> Implement an RSS feed to follow different band pages and blogs</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Progress</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>I decided on using <a href=\"https://github.com/gokadzev/Musify\">this</a> project called Musify by Gokadzev.
